# 🌟 LifeDash

**LifeDash** is a personal productivity dashboard designed for students and teens to organize their daily lives, track goals, log thoughts, and build healthy habits — all in one place.

Created by Sawyer Wetson, this project is built entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with minimal AI assistance. It's meant to be a fully offline, privacy-friendly, and easy-to-use tool that helps you stay on track without distractions.
